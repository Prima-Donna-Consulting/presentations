Presentations by Joe Woodhouse, Prima Donna Consulting.

This repository contains only presentations, no code. If viewing on a mobile device you may have to click "View code" to expand the listing and show the presentations. Depending on your device you may not be able to directly view the presentation through your browser but you can always download the PDF. No GitHub login or account required.

This will always contain the most up to date version of the presentations. As older ones are brought up to date they'll be added here.

If you've arrived here from a QR code in a live or very recent presentation it may still be in "pre-print" mode. It's fairly typical for me to add to presentations immediately after presenting them based on comments, questions, and any typos that survived proofreading. I'll indicate when something is in pre-print mode. If there's no pre-print tag then it's the fully proofed version.
